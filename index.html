<p>Here are some useful things to know for managing an Exim 4 server. This
assumes a prior working knowledge of SMTP, MTAs, and a UNIX shell prompt.</p>


<h3>Message-IDs and spool files</h3>

<p>The message-IDs that Exim uses to refer to messages in its queue are
mixed-case alpha-numeric, and take the form of: XXXXXX-YYYYYY-ZZ. Most
commands related to managing the queue and logging use these
message-ids.</p>

<p>There are three -- count 'em, THREE -- files for each message in the
spool directory. If you're dealing with these files by hand, instead of
using the appropriate exim commands as detailed below, make sure you get
them all, and don't leave Exim with remnants of messages in the queue. I
used to mess directly with these files when I first started running Exim
machines, but thanks to the utilities described below, I haven't needed to
do that in many months.</p>

<p>Files in /var/spool/exim/msglog contain logging information for each message
and are named the same as the message-id.</p>

<p>Files in /var/spool/exim/input are named after the message-id, plus a suffix
denoting whether it is the envelope header (-H) or message data (-D).

</p><p>These directories may contain further hashed subdirectories to deal with
larger mail queues, so don't expect everything to always appear directly in the
top /var/spool/exim/input or /var/spool/exim/msglog directories; any searches
or greps will need to be recursive. See if there is a proper way to do what
you're doing before working directly on the spool files.</p>


<h3>Basic information</h3>

<p>Print a count of the messages in the queue:</p>

<pre class="shell"><b>root@localhost#</b> exim -bpc
</pre>

<p>Print a listing of the messages in the queue (time queued, size, message-id,
sender, recipient):</p>

<pre class="shell"><b>root@localhost#</b> exim -bp
</pre>

<p>Print a summary of messages in the queue (count, volume, oldest, newest,
domain, and totals):</p>

<pre class="shell"><b>root@localhost#</b> exim -bp | exiqsumm
</pre>

<p>Print what Exim is doing right now:</p>

<pre class="shell"><b>root@localhost#</b> exiwhat
</pre>

<p>Test how exim will route a given address:</p>

<pre class="shell"><b>root@localhost#</b> exim -bt alias@localdomain.com
user@thishost.com
    &lt;-- alias@localdomain.com
  router = localuser, transport = local_delivery
<b>root@localhost#</b> exim -bt user@thishost.com
user@thishost.com
  router = localuser, transport = local_delivery
<b>root@localhost#</b> exim -bt user@remotehost.com
  router = lookuphost, transport = remote_smtp
  host mail.remotehost.com [1.2.3.4] MX=0
</pre>

<p>Run a pretend SMTP transaction from the command line, as if it were
coming from the given IP address. This will display Exim's checks, ACLs,
and filters as they are applied. The message will NOT actually be
delivered.</p>

<pre class="shell"><b>root@localhost#</b> exim -bh 192.168.11.22
</pre>

<p>Display all of Exim's configuration settings:</p>

<pre class="shell"><b>root@localhost#</b> exim -bP
</pre>



<h3>Searching the queue with exiqgrep</h3>

<p>Exim includes a utility that is quite nice for grepping through the
queue, called exiqgrep. 
<a href="http://www.exim.org/exim-html-4.50/doc/html/spec_49.html#IX2895">
Learn it. Know it. Live it.</a> If you're not using this, and if you're not
familiar with the various flags it uses, you're probably doing things the
hard way, like piping `exim -bp` into awk, grep, cut, or `wc -l`. Don't
make life harder than it already is.</p>

<p>First, various flags that control what messages are matched. These can
be combined to come up with a very particular search.</p>

<p>Use -f to search the queue for messages from a specific sender:</p>

<pre class="shell"><b>root@localhost#</b> exiqgrep -f [luser]@domain
</pre>

<p>Use -r to search the queue for messages for a specific recipient/domain:</p>

<pre class="shell"><b>root@localhost#</b> exiqgrep -r [luser]@domain
</pre>

<p>Use -o to print messages older than the specified number of seconds. For
example, messages older than 1 day:</p>

<pre class="shell"><b>root@localhost#</b> exiqgrep -o 86400 [...]
</pre>

<p>Use -y to print messages that are younger than the specified number of
seconds. For example, messages less than an hour old:</p>

<pre class="shell"><b>root@localhost#</b> exiqgrep -y 3600 [...]
</pre>

<p>Use -s to match the size of a message with a regex. For example, 700-799
bytes:</p>

<pre class="shell"><b>root@localhost#</b> exiqgrep -s '^7..$' [...]
</pre>

<p>Use -z to match only frozen messages, or -x to match only unfrozen
messages.</p>


<p>There are also a few flags that control the display of the output.</p>

<p>Use -i to print just the message-id as a result of one of the above two
searches:</p>

<pre class="shell"><b>root@localhost#</b> exiqgrep -i [ -r | -f ] ...
</pre>

<p>Use -c to print a count of messages matching one of the above
searches:</p>

<pre class="shell"><b>root@localhost#</b> exiqgrep -c ...
</pre>

<p>Print just the message-id of the entire queue:</p>

<pre class="shell"><b>root@localhost#</b> exiqgrep -i
</pre>


<h3>Managing the queue</h3>

<p>The main exim binary (/usr/sbin/exim) is used with various flags to make
things happen to messages in the queue. Most of these require one or more
message-IDs to be specified in the command line, which is where `exiqgrep
-i` as described above really comes in handy.</p>

<p>Start a queue run:</p>

<pre class="shell"><b>root@localhost#</b> exim -q -v
</pre>

<p>Start a queue run for just local deliveries:</p>

<pre class="shell"><b>root@localhost#</b> exim -ql -v
</pre>

<p>Remove a message from the queue:</p>

<pre class="shell"><b>root@localhost#</b> exim -Mrm &lt;message-id&gt; [ &lt;message-id&gt; ... ]
</pre>

<p>Freeze a message:</p>

<pre class="shell"><b>root@localhost#</b> exim -Mf &lt;message-id&gt; [ &lt;message-id&gt; ... ]
</pre>

<p>Thaw a message:</p>

<pre class="shell"><b>root@localhost#</b> exim -Mt &lt;message-id&gt; [ &lt;message-id&gt; ... ]
</pre>

<p>Deliver a message, whether it's frozen or not, whether the retry time
has been reached or not:</p>

<pre class="shell"><b>root@localhost#</b> exim -M &lt;message-id&gt; [ &lt;message-id&gt; ... ]
</pre>

<p>Deliver a message, but only if the retry time has been reached:</p>

<pre class="shell"><b>root@localhost#</b> exim -Mc &lt;message-id&gt; [ &lt;message-id&gt; ... ]
</pre>

<p>Force a message to fail and bounce as "cancelled by administrator":</p>

<pre class="shell"><b>root@localhost#</b> exim -Mg &lt;message-id&gt; [ &lt;message-id&gt; ... ]
</pre>

<p>Remove all frozen messages:</p>

<pre class="shell"><b>root@localhost#</b> exiqgrep -z -i | xargs exim -Mrm
</pre>

<p>Remove all messages older than five days (86400 * 5 = 432000
seconds):</p>

<pre class="shell"><b>root@localhost#</b> exiqgrep -o 432000 -i | xargs exim -Mrm
</pre>

<p>Freeze all queued mail from a given sender:</p>

<pre class="shell"><b>root@localhost#</b> exiqgrep -i -f luser@example.tld | xargs exim -Mf
</pre>

<p>View a message's headers:</p>

<pre class="shell"><b>root@localhost#</b> exim -Mvh &lt;message-id&gt;
</pre>

<p>View a message's body:</p>

<pre class="shell"><b>root@localhost#</b> exim -Mvb &lt;message-id&gt;
</pre>

<p>View a message's logs:</p>

<pre class="shell"><b>root@localhost#</b> exim -Mvl &lt;message-id&gt;
</pre>

<p>Add a recipient to a message:</p>

<pre class="shell"><b>root@localhost#</b> exim -Mar &lt;message-id&gt; &lt;address&gt; [ &lt;address&gt; ... ]
</pre>

<p>Edit the sender of a message:</p>

<pre class="shell"><b>root@localhost#</b> exim -Mes &lt;message-id&gt; &lt;address&gt;
</pre>



<h3>Access control</h3>

<p>Exim allows you to apply
<a href="http://www.exim.org/exim-html-4.50/doc/html/spec_39.html">access
control lists</a>
at various points of the SMTP transaction by specifying an ACL to use and
defining its conditions in exim.conf. You could start with the HELO
string.</p>

<pre class="code"># Specify the ACL to use after HELO
acl_smtp_helo = check_helo

# Conditions for the check_helo ACL:
check_helo:

    deny message = Gave HELO/EHLO as "friend"
    log_message = HELO/EHLO friend
    condition = ${if eq {$sender_helo_name}{friend} {yes}{no}}

    deny message = Gave HELO/EHLO as our IP address
    log_message = HELO/EHLO our IP address
    condition = ${if eq {$sender_helo_name}{$interface_address} {yes}{no}}

    accept
</pre>

<p>NOTE: Pursue HELO checking at your own peril.  The HELO is fairly
unimportant in the grand scheme of SMTP these days, so don't put too much
faith in whatever it contains.  Some spam might seem to use a telltale HELO
string, but you might be surprised at how many legitimate messages start
off with a questionable HELO as well.  Anyway, it's just as easy for a
spammer to send a proper HELO than it is to send HELO im.a.spammer, so
consider yourself lucky if you're able to stop much spam this way.</p>

<p>Next, you can perform a check on the sender address or remote host.
This shows how to do that after the RCPT TO command; if you reject here, as
opposed to rejecting after the MAIL FROM, you'll have better data to
log, such as who the message was intended for.</p>

<pre class="code"># Specify the ACL to use after RCPT TO
acl_smtp_rcpt = check_recipient

# Conditions for the check_recipient ACL
check_recipient:

    # [...]

    drop hosts = /etc/exim_reject_hosts
    drop senders = /etc/exim_reject_senders

    # [ Probably a whole lot more... ]
</pre>

<p>This example uses two plain text files as blacklists. Add appropriate
entries to these files - hostnames/IP addresses to /etc/exim_reject_hosts,
addresses to /etc/exim_reject_senders, one entry per line.</p>

<p>It is also possible to perform
<a href="http://www.exim.org/exim-html-4.50/doc/html/spec_40.html">content
scanning</a> using a regex against the body of a message, though obviously
this can cause Exim to use more CPU than it otherwise would need to,
especially on large messages.</p>

<pre class="code"># Specify the ACL to use after DATA
acl_smtp_data = check_message

# Conditions for the check_messages ACL
check_message:

    deny message = "Sorry, Charlie: $regex_match_string"
    regex = ^Subject:: .*Lower your self-esteem by becoming a sysadmin

    accept
</pre>


<h3>Fix SMTP-Auth for Pine</h3>

<p>If pine can't use SMTP authentication on an Exim host and just returns
an "unable to authenticate" message without even asking for a password, add
the following line to exim.conf:</p>

<pre class="code">  begin authenticators

  fixed_plain:
  driver = plaintext
  public_name = PLAIN
  server_condition = "${perl{checkuserpass}{$1}{$2}{$3}}"
  server_set_id = $2
&gt;<b>  server_prompts = :</b>
</pre>

<p>This was a problem on CPanel Exim builds awhile ago, but they seem to
have added this line to their current stock configuration.</p>


<h3>Log the subject line</h3>

<p>This is one of the most useful configuration tweaks I've ever found for
Exim. Add this to exim.conf, and you can log the subject lines of messages
that pass through your server. This is great for troubleshooting, and for
getting a very rough idea of what messages may be spam.</p>

<pre class="code">log_selector = +subject
</pre>

<p><a href="http://www.exim.org/exim-html-4.50/doc/html/spec_48.html#SECT48.15">Reducing
or increasing what is logged</a>.</p>


<h3>Disable identd lookups</h3>

<p>Frankly, I don't think <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1413.txt">identd</a> has been useful for a
long time, if ever.  Identd relies on the connecting host to confirm the
identity (system UID) of the remote user who owns the process that is
making the network connection.  This may be of some use in the world of
shell accounts and IRC users, but it really has no place on a high-volume
SMTP server, where the UID is often simply "mail" or whatever the remote
MTA runs as, which is useless to know. It's overhead, and results in
nothing but delays while the identd query is refused or times out. You
can stop your Exim server from making these queries by setting the timeout
to zero seconds in exim.conf:</p>

<pre class="code">rfc1413_query_timeout = 0s
</pre>


<h3>Disable Attachment Blocking</h3>

<p>To disable the executable-attachment blocking that many Cpanel servers
do by default but don't provide any controls for on a per-domain basis, add
the following block to the beginning of the /etc/antivirus.exim file:</p>

<pre class="code">if $header_to: matches "example\.com|example2\.com"
then
  finish
endif
</pre>

<p>It is probably possible to use a separate file to list these domains,
but I haven't had to do this enough times to warrant setting such a thing
up.</p>


<h3>Searching the logs with exigrep</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.exim.org/exim-html-4.50/doc/html/spec_49.html#IX2911">exigrep</a>
utility (not to be confused with exiqgrep) is used to search an exim log
for a string or pattern. It will print all log entries with the same
internal message-id as those that matched the pattern, which is very handy
since any message will take up at least three lines in the log. exigrep
will search the entire content of a log entry, not just particular
fields.</p>

<p>One can search for messages sent from a particular IP address:</p>

<pre class="shell"><b>root@localhost#</b> exigrep '&lt;= .* \[12.34.56.78\] ' /path/to/exim_log
</pre>

<p>Search for messages sent to a particular IP address:</p>

<pre class="shell"><b>root@localhost#</b> exigrep '=&gt; .* \[12.34.56.78\]' /path/to/exim_log
</pre>

<p>This example searches for outgoing messages, which have the "=&gt;"
symbol, sent to "user@domain.tld".  The pipe to grep for the "&lt;=" symbol
will match only the lines with information on the sender - the From
address, the sender's IP address, the message size, the message ID, and the
subject line if you have enabled logging the subject. The purpose of doing
such a search is that the desired information is not on the same log line
as the string being searched for.</p>

<pre class="shell"><b>root@localhost#</b> exigrep '=&gt; .*user@domain.tld' /path/to/exim_log | fgrep '&lt;='
</pre>

<p>Generate and display Exim stats from a logfile:</p>

<pre class="shell"><b>root@localhost#</b> eximstats /path/to/exim_mainlog</pre>

<p>Same as above, with less verbose output:</p>

<pre class="shell"><b>root@localhost#</b> eximstats -ne -nr -nt /path/to/exim_mainlog</pre>

<p>Same as above, for one particular day:</p>

<pre class="shell"><b>root@localhost#</b> fgrep YYYY-MM-DD /path/to/exim_mainlog | eximstats</pre>



<h3>Bonus!</h3>

<p>To delete all queued messages containing a certain string in the
body:</p>

<pre class="shell"><b>root@localhost#</b> grep -lr 'a certain string' /var/spool/exim/input/ | \
                sed -e 's/^.*\/\([a-zA-Z0-9-]*\)-[DH]$/\1/g' | xargs exim -Mrm
</pre>

<p>Note that the above only delves into /var/spool/exim in order to grep
for queue files with the given string, and that's just because exiqgrep
doesn't have a feature to grep the actual bodies of messages. If you are
deleting these files directly, YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG! Use the appropriate
exim command to properly deal with the queue.</p>

<p>If you have to feed many, many message-ids (such as the output of an
`exiqgrep -i` command that returns a lot of matches) to an exim command,
you may exhaust the limit of your shell's command line arguments.  In that
case, pipe the listing of message-ids into xargs to run only a limited
number of them at once. For example, to remove thousands of messages sent
from joe@example.com:</p>

<pre class="shell"><b>root@localhost#</b> exiqgrep -i -f '&lt;joe@example.com&gt;' | xargs exim -Mrm
</pre>


<h3>Speaking of "DOING IT WRONG" -- Attention, CPanel forum readers</h3>

<p>I get a number of hits to this page from a link in
<a href="http://forums.cpanel.net/showthread.php?t=54858">this post</a> at the
CPanel forums. The question is:</p>

<blockquote>
Due to spamming, spoofing from fields, etc., etc., etc., I am finding it
necessary to spend more time to clear the exim queue from time to time.
[...] what command would I use to delete the queue
</blockquote>

<p>The answer is: Just turn exim off, because your customers are better off
knowing that email simply isn't running on your server, than having their
queued messages deleted without notice.</p>

<p>Or, figure out what is happening. The examples given in that post pay no
regard to the legitimacy of any message, they simply delete everything,
making the presumption that if a message is in the queue, it's junk. That
is total fallacy.  There are a number of reasons legitimate mail can end up
in the queue.  Maybe your backups or CPanel's "upcp" process are running,
and your load average is high -- exim goes into a queue-only mode at a
certain threshold, where it stops trying to deliver messages as they come
in and just queues them until the load goes back down. Or, maybe it's an
outgoing message, and the DNS lookup failed, or the connection to the
domain's MX failed, or maybe the remote MX is busy or greylisting you with
a 4xx deferral. These are all temporary failures, not permanent ones, and
the whole point of having temporary failures in SMTP and a mail queue in
your MTA is to be able to try again after awhile.</p>

<p>Exim already purges messages from the queue after the period of time
specified in exim.conf. If you have this value set appropriately, there is
absolutely no point in removing everything from your queue every day with a
cron job. <strong>You will lose legitimate mail, and the sender and
recipient will never know if or why it happened.</strong> Do not do
this!</p>

<p>If you regularly have a large number of messages in your queue, find out
why they are there. If they are outbound messages, see who is sending them,
where they're addressed to, and why they aren't getting there.  If they are
inbound messages, find out why they aren't getting delivered to your user's
account. If you need to delete some, use exiqgrep to pick out just the ones
that should be deleted.</p>


<h3>Reload the configuration</h3>

<p>After making changes to exim.conf, you need to give the main exim pid a
SIGHUP to re-exec it and have the configuration re-read. Sure, you could
stop and start the service, but that's overkill and causes a few seconds of
unnecessary downtime. Just do this:</p>

<pre class="shell"><b>root@localhost#</b> kill -HUP `cat /var/spool/exim/exim-daemon.pid`
</pre>

<p>You should then see something resembling the following in exim_mainlog:</p>

<pre class="code">pid 1079: SIGHUP received: re-exec daemon
exim 4.52 daemon started: pid=1079, -q1h, listening for SMTP on port 25 (IPv4)
</pre>


<h3>Read The Fucking Manual</h3>

<h3>Any questions?</h3>

<p>Well, don't ask me! I'm one guy, with just enough time and Exim skills
to keep my own stuff running okay.  There are several (perhaps even
dozens) of people on the Internet who know way more than me, and who are
willing to help out random strangers. Check into the
<a href="http://lists.exim.org/lurker/list/exim-users.html">Exim users
mailing list</a>, or one of the many web-based gateways to that list. And
good luck.</p>
